# OS-RISC-V-
Operating System for a RISC-V computer


# Instructions

In teams of four: Make an operating system for a RISC-V computer. That's right, make a working command line operating system. Try to get as many features as possible. Supposedly, you can do this in Claude (at least it told me it did it). *Supposedly* AI can do everything we can do but that doesn't actually match to what I've seen (https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai)



Our default AI will be OpenAI's ChatGPT EDU (provided by the school). If you have another tool, you may use one or more costing ~$20 or less/mo.



(Log all chats, I suggest documenting and building a README as you go along)

Step one: Spend about 2 hours generating something, adding as many features as you can:

loading separate programs
running multiple programs simultaneously
synchronization
protection
file system?
How to create/load new programs, etc.
anything else you can think of).
Step two: Get it running in QEMU (5 minutes to 5 hours). For your README, specifically, give the commands to get this up and running on a lab machine.

Step three: Understand what you have (I suggest working together or at least separating the work). One thing I do like about AI is using it to explain code.

Step four: Complete documentation and submit.



(Step 5 will be to add a feature or two, that will be a final small amount of work and program 3).



Try to get it up and running in QEMU using the virt Generic Platform. https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/riscv/virt.html . You may have to figure out how to get it running on the lab machines (QEMU not installed afaict).
